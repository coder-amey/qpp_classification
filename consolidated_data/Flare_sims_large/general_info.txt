Note files included for all flares with (in Sims_noise) and without noise (Sims_nonoise)
    

1st flare shape:

Based on Davenport.

details in:
	file_info_r&wnoise.txt - sims contain red and white noise
	file_info_rnoise.txt - sims contain red noise
	file_info_wnoise.txt - sims contain white noise

columns: #sim_number, ID, t_peak, amp_scale, P, new_length, offset, a_qpp, B, t_e, phi, sn, r, sn_red

sim_number is the simulation number
ID tells you the number associated with the fits file.
t_peak: location of the peak, randomly determined
amp_scale: amplitude of flare, randomly determined
P: period of qpp, randomly determined
new_length: length of flare, randomly determined (originally simulated as rising phase from -1 to 0, declining phase from 0-19
offset: offset of whole lightcurve from 0, randomly determined between 0-100
a_qpp: amplitude of qpp, fixed relative to amplitude of flare as 0.7, 0.5 or 0.3, A in equation for QPP at top
B: always 0 so can ignore (in qpp equation above)
t_e: decay time of qpp, varied systematically between 1 and 5, tau in equation above
phi: phase of qpp, randomly generated between 0 and 2pi, in equation above
sn: S/N of QPP relative to white noise
r: used to determine red noise, randomly generated between -0.09 and 0.09
sn_red: S/N of red noise, randomly determined

Note that when only red [white] noise, the parameters for white [red] noise may still be non-zero

2nd flare shape:

Based on two half Gaussians

details in:

columns: #sim_number, id, t_peak, amp_scale, sig_r, sig_f, new_length, offset, P, a_qpp, B, t_e, phi, sn, r, sn_red, bgd, grad_scale, t1
sim_number is the simulation number
ID tells you the number associated with the fits file.
t_peak: location of the peak, randomly determined
amp_scale: amplitude of flare, randomly determined
sig_r: width of gaussian for rising phase, randomly determined between 0.1-3
sig_f: width of gaussian for decay phase, randomly determined between 5-20
new_length: length of flare, randomly determined (originally simulated as rising phase from -7 to 0, declining phase from 0-19 (may have an error in NEED TO CHECK)
offset: offset of whole lightcurve from 0, randomly determined between 0-100
P: period of qpp, randomly determined
a_qpp: amplitude of qpp, fixed relative to amplitude of flare as 0.7, 0.5 or 0.3, A in equation for QPP at top
B: always 0 so can ignore (in qpp equation above)
t_e: decay time of qpp, varied systematically between 1 and 5, tau in equation above
phi: phase of qpp, randomly generated between 0 and 2pi, in equation above
sn: S/N of QPP relative to white noise
r: used to determine red noise, randomly generated between -0.09 and 0.09
sn_red: S/N of red noise, randomly determined
bgd: type of background - ignore - I have not included a background but forgot to change output
grad_scale: ditto
t1: ditto

Note that when only red [white] noise, the parameters for white [red] noise may still be non-zero
